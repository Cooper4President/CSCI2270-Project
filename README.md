# CSCI2270 Final Project
Cooper's CSCI2270 Project.

Centrality: A utility library for node graph centrality analysis.

## Project summary:
Summary will be updated as development progresses. Project is currently in the concept stage.

  This library is intended to provide tools for quantifying centrality in node graphs/networks. Centrality is a measure of the 'importance' of a node within a given network. Node graph centrality algorithms are used in many applications, such as social network analytics, and Google's PageRank algorithm. The core feature of this library is to build node graphs from adjacency matrices (loaded in from a file), and calculate the centrality 'scores' of each node. The user should be able to query the centrality score for any given node. Capabilities to find nodes with the highest/lowest score are also planned. One or more different algorithms for calculating centrality may be implemented. These may be an implementation of an existing technique (Eigenvector centrality, Katz centrality, etc) or a new concept.
